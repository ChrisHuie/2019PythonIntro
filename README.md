## Overview
The goal of this brief course is to provide you with a fun introduction to the world of development with Python.

#### Here's what we'll be doing:
* Talking about the Python ecosystem and it's place alongside other languages
* Overview of basic Python and fundamental programming concepts
* Playing around and break things


#### What is programming?
Programming is giving your computer a set of instructions to perform a task. 
It's similar to creating a recipe that someone else then has to follow.
This should become more clear as we dive in :-)

## What is Python?

### A VERY brief history

Created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.

Python is Known ease of learning, code readability (must use code indents), and a massive ecosystem of libraries that easily expand its usefeullness is many fields.

Read more about the history of Python [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)).


### Who uses Python?

A lot of places do!

- Large Companies (Google, Facebook)
- Startups
- Agencies
- Majority of companies doing data science 

### What can you do with Python

- Web Development
	- Back-End (frameworks: Django, Flask, more)
- Data Science and AI
	- Data Analysis
	- Machine Learning
	- Deep Learning
	- Computer Vision
	- Natural Language Processing
- [Embedded(Hardware)](https://micropython.org/)
- Devops

#### Popular Frameworks and libraries to keep in mind

When learning more about Python you'll probably see someo of these pop up as you continue to study

- Web
	- Django
	- Flask
	- pyramid

- Data Science
	- Tensorflow
	- Keras
	- Numpy
	- Pandas
	- Scikit Learn
	- OpenCV

*Note*: if you're thinking of exploring data science with python look into using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to manage your python and data libraries

Also [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true) is a awesome place to start as well without having to install anything!
